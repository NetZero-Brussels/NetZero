# NetZero

##Introduction
Engaging Communities to Combat Climate Change with Transparency and Ease.

The problems we want to solve:
- Reality: Measuring and offsetting carbon emissions is difficult for companies, and climate projects face low funding and awareness.
- Social: The CSRD makes sustainability reporting challenging for EU companies, highlighting the need for better solutions to generate carbon footprint data and offset emissions.
- Technical: Web2 solutions lack transparency and scalability.

How it works:
- Gamification: Engaging users with leaderboards and point systems, streaks, challenge other users with greener lifestyles.
- Crowdfunding: Facilitating contributions to green initiatives. 
- Proof and Verifiability: Ensuring transparency with a tamper-proof system. 
- Reputation: Creating green proofs and approval stamps for carbon footprints.

Key Features:
- Leaderboard to encourage competition and engagement. 
- GPS integration for accurate, private data. 
- Distribution system for donations to green projects. 
- Seamless transactions on chain + transparent flow of funds stored in vault.
- Highly accurate mathematical models for footprint.

"The global carbon offset market is projected to reach $200 billion by 2030."

Producing carbon emission services could be challenging, for example:
- Carbon emission reports
- AI for data analytics
- Affordable monthly subscriptions
...but not using it can be very expensive for companies

For next steps: we will test with users for Feedback Integration
Reach out to climate projects & organizations such as https://www.energyweb.org/

##How its made
Celo Minipay: Seamless onboarding, on ramp and gasless transfers.
The Graph: A new Net Zero Subgraph will be created for feeding notifications to the end user on funds, emission offsets, donations.
Flare:  Data audit for carbon emission counters and authenticity of the data origin
Arbitrum Stylus: Efficient, low-latency on-chain calculations of carbon emissions including advanced maths libraries for trust and transparency.
Hyperlane: Interoperability between Celo and Arbitrum for optimal transparency and reputation management.
Blockscout: Contract verification and user receipts.
